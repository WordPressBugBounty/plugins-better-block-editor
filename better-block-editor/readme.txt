Better Block Editor (BBE) — responsive layout controls, on-scroll animations, and pre-made site templates for Block Editor.
== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwZZb_XIkJs

Better Block Editor (BBE) adds responsive layout controls, hover effects, on-scroll animations, and ready-to-use site templates to Block Editor. It’s not another page builder. It doesn’t replace core blocks or add bloat — BBE just adds the missing settings where needed. It works with your current block theme and plugins, so your existing content stays intact.
=== Highlights ===
* Responsive Settings for Row, Stack, Grid, Columns, Button, Navigation, and text (Heading, Paragraph) blocks — choose a breakpoint, then adjust orientation, spacing, and alignment at that breakpoint.
* Responsive Visibility for any block — set the default visibility state and change it at a chosen breakpoint.
* Prevent Shrinking for elements set to Fixed or Fit-content sizes — keeps complex layouts intact on small screens.
* Animation on Scroll — configurable animation effect, easing, duration, and delay.
* Hover colors for Button and Navigation.
* Pre-made Sites and Partial Import — bring over a full site or a single page/section; assets import automatically.
* One-click customization for imported content — set primary, secondary, and neutral colors; BBE creates a balanced palette in one click.
* Native Block Editor integration — no lock-in, lightweight, GPL, and free.

= How it works =
Import a template and make it yours in minutes with the one-click customization tool. Mix pages and sections from different templates with Partial Import. Create a professional website in hours — not weeks!
== Features ==
* Responsive Settings for Row and Stack — change orientation (convert Row ↔ Stack), justification, vertical alignment, and spacing at a chosen breakpoint. This panel is key to controllable responsive behavior in Block Editor sites.
* Prevent Shrinking — available when a block’s width/height is set to Fit content or Fixed; prevents fixed-size elements from collapsing on small screens.
* Responsive Visibility for any block — set the default visibility state (visible/hidden) and change it at a chosen breakpoint.
* Responsive Settings for Grid — replaces the core Stack on mobile with a dedicated panel to choose the stacking breakpoint and adjust spacing at that breakpoint.
* Improved Stack on mobile for Columns — choose the breakpoint and optionally reverse the column order at that breakpoint.
* Navigation overlay menu — replaces the fixed Mobile option with Responsive; pick the exact breakpoint when navigation collapses to a menu icon (useful for headers).
* Hover color for Navigation — add hover color controls for menu and submenu items.
* Responsive Settings for Button — control the orientation of inner buttons (stack or reverse), plus justification and vertical alignment at a chosen breakpoint.
* Hover colors for Button — set text, background, and border colors on hover.
* Responsive Settings for Post Template (Grid view) — stack posts and adjust spacing at a chosen breakpoint.
* Animation on Scroll for any block — subtle reveal on scroll with configurable effect, easing, duration, and delay.
* Responsive text alignment — add alignment controls at a chosen breakpoint for Heading, Paragraph, and select text-based blocks.
* SVG Icon block + sanitized SVG upload — place SVG icons anywhere; control size, color, hover color, and linking.
* Breakpoints — edit built-in breakpoints and add or remove custom breakpoints.
== Requirements & Compatibility ==
* WordPress 6.8 or later
* Uses the native Block Editor (Gutenberg)
* Works with block themes; does not target third-party page builders
